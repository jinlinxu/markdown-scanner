## Before we can accept your pull request

If our automated process determines that the pull request is significant, you will be required to 
sign the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before the pull request can be reviewed.

Signing the Contribution License Agreement (CLA) does not grant you rights to commit to the main 
repository, but it does mean we can review your pull request and consider your contributions to the project.

You can view, download, and/or sign the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/). This is only 
required if you wish to have your pull request considered.

## Use GitHub, Git, and this repository

For details of how to use GitHub to contribute to a project most effectively, see the [Contributing to open source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) articles.

### Contribute feature or bug fix

To make the contribution process as seamless as possible for you, follow this procedure.

1. **Fork** the repository into your own account.
2. **Create a new branch** for the bug/feature you are working on.
3. Implement the new functionality / bug fixes and add approriate test scenarios.
4. Submit a pull request to the main repository **master** branch.

Limit each branch to a single concept/feature to streamline the workflow and reduce the 
chance of merge conflicts.

Multiple small bug fixes may be combined in a single pull request, although if they
become significant you may be requested to separate them into multiple branches / requests.
